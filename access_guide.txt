# Beatwell Website Access Guide

## 1. Local Network (LAN) Access
You can access the website from other devices on the same Wi-Fi/Network.
Use the following URL (based on your current IP):
http://10.23.177.151:5001

Note: Ensure your Windows Firewall allows Python to accept incoming connections on port 5001.

## 2. Public Internet Access (Cloudflare Tunnel)
Since `cloudflared` is installed, you can generate a public link easily.

Run the provided script in PowerShell:
`.\start_beatwell_public.ps1`

This will:
1. Ensure the website is running.
2. Start a secure tunnel.
3. Give you a link like `https://random-name.trycloudflare.com`.
